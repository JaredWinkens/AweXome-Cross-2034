Above the game loop in main.py I created a Player object.
I then called the Player's jump() and update() functions in the approriate spots of the loop.
I manually tested that these 2 functions in the Player class work as expected by the following methods.  

Test Player().jump() function:
    1. The player can jump by pressing the space bar. (PASSED)
    2. The player cannot jump while in the air. (PASSED)
    3. No other key press would move the player in any way. (PASSED)
    4. The player cannot jump off the screen in any direction. (PASSED)

Test Player().update() function:
    The position of the player is updated correctly by:
        5. jumping stright up (PASSED)
        6. falling (PASSED)
    7. tested that the player always stays on the platform no matter what keys are pressed or how the player moves. (PASSED)

Results: 7/7 tests passed
