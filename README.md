## How to install AweXome Cross 2034 from source code

1. Have PyInstaller installed on your system(I recommend doing this in command prompt) use this command to install it: `pip install -U pyinstaller`

2. `cd` into the folder that holds the `main.py` file. For example: `cd cs370`, then `cd AweXome-Cross-2034`

3. Run the command `python -m PyInstaller --onefile main.py`. This will create a `dist` folder if there is not one present and put the new executable file in it.

4. Then you can either move the executable file into the AweXome Cross 2034 folder and run it or make a copy of the `assets` folder and place it in the `dist` folder with the executable

5. Run the executable and play test it.
