Feature: Player collsion with small enemy. 
Description: Player moves to the left of the screen when colliding with a small enemy. 

Code: (see test_small_enemy_collsion.py)
    When colliding with small enemy the player moves to the left by five pixel then gradually
    returns back to its initial position (passed). 

    Test to ensures the player's position smoothly approaches its initial x position  
    over 100 steps, using a scalar factor to control movement. It verifies the position consistently 
    gets closer to the target and reaches it within a small tolerance of 0.01. (Failed)

        Due to the player's initial position being set at the center in the Player class, this test will 
        always fail. To resolve this, the player's initial position should be changed to the default position 
        (topleft). However, making this change will require adjustments to other game features 
        to maintain consistency.
        
Visual: 
    Checked to see if the player collides with the cop when moving to the left of the screen. (Failed)
        - Intentionally collided with a small enemy to check if the player and cop would collide 
        immediately afterward. Ran the game 15 times, and the player and cop did collided 
        in all 15 attempts (Failed).
