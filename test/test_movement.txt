Above the game loop in main.py I created a Player object.
I then called the Player's jump() and update() functions in the approriate spots of the loop.
I manually tested that these 2 functions in the Player class work as expected by the following methods.  

Test Player().jump() function:
    - I tested if the player can jump by pressing the space bar. (PASSED)
    - I tested that the player cannot jump while in the air. (PASSED)
    - I tested that no other key press would move the player in any way. (PASSED)
    - I tested that the player cannot jump off the screen in any direction. (PASSED)

Test Player().update() function:
    - I tested if the position of the player is updated correctly by:
        - jumping stright up (PASSED)
        - falling (PASSED)
    - I tested that the player always stays on the platform no matter what keys are pressed or how the player moves. (PASSED)

Results: All tests passed. The Player movement funcionality is working as expected.
